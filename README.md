Exploration of the Lichess.org Game Database 

***

## Overview
Lichess generously made available for free a [database](https://database.lichess.org/) of all games ever played on its website.  The goal of this project is to explore the database using **solely R** and not relying on additional tools so as to allow others to leverage the code in this project and perform their own analyses with as little start-up time as possible.

## Analyses

* [Player Distributions with Game Types and Finishes](https://cdn.rawgit.com/chris-w-r/lichess-database-exploration/664ae51cc68ed1829f2fcc39855eeb9b8ddb0c2c/Player%20Distributions%20with%20Game%20Types%20and%20Finishes.nb.html) *(**HTML** report)*

* [Lichess Database: Which openings are most successful - interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chris.w.r#!/vizhome/OpeningWinningPercentages/OpeningWinningPercentagesDashboard) *(**Tableau** dashboard)*

* [Lichess Database: First Move Preference by Elo Range](https://redd.it/6yjzl6) *(**Image** posted to r/chess on Reddit)*
