Exploration of the Lichess.org Game Database 

***

## Overview
Lichess generously made available for free a [database](https://database.lichess.org/) of all games ever played on its website.  The goal of this project is to explore the database using **solely R** and not relying on additional tools so as to allow others to leverage the code in this project and perform their own analyses with as little start-up time as possible.

## Analyses

A massive **thank you** to [Lichess](https://lichess.org/)!  Supplying the entire database of this size for download for free is absolutely incredible!
